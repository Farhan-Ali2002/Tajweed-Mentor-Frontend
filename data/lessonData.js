      description:
        "In Tajweed, Idgham with Ghunnah (assimilation with prolongation) occurs when a Noon Sakinah (unpronounced noon, نْ) or Tanween (nunation markings) is followed by specific letters: Waw (و), Ya (ي), Noon (ن), or Meem (م) - known as the 'letters of Idgham with Ghunnah.' Here, the 'n' sound isn't completely eliminated. Instead, it merges with the following letter, creating a slightly elongated nasal sound (Ghunnah). This merging produces a smoother transition and a subtle emphasis. For example, in the word 'من يرحم' (man yarhamu, meaning 'who is merciful'), the 'n' at the end of 'man' merges with the 'y' in 'yarhamu,'' creating a prolonged nasal sound before the 'y' begins. It's important to distinguish this from Idgham without Ghunnah, where the 'n' vanishes entirely. Remember, Idgham with Ghunnah applies to these specific letters following the 'n' sound.",

        'In Tajweed, Idgham without Ghunnah (assimilation without prolongation) occurs when the letters Raa (ر) or Laam (ل) come directly before a Noon Sakinah (unpronounced noon, نْ) or Tanween (nunation markings indicating grammatical case, likeًـا or ًـن). Here, the "n" sound disappears completely. The preceding Raa or Laam merges its sound with the following letter, creating a stronger emphasis. This is different from Idgham with Ghunnah, where the "n" sound is slightly elongated. Remember, Idgham without Ghunnah happens specifically with Raa and Laam, not other nasal sounds. ',

      arabicTitle: 'اللام الشمسية',
      description:
        'The Laam Shamsiya rule applies when the definite article "al" precedes a word starting with one of the fourteen Sun Letters. This creates a stronger emphasis on the initial sound of the Sun Letter, as the "l" sound in "al" assimilates with it and becomes silent. Think of Sun Letters and Moon Letters as a memory aid, not a literal connection to the sun or moon. Examples include "ash-shams" (the sun) and "as-sirat" (the path). Mastering Laam Shamsiya pronunciation improves the accuracy and beauty of your Arabic recitation. You can find audio demonstrations online to practice.',

      title: '8- Wow Madd (Extended Wow)',
      arabicTitle: 'مد الواو',
      description:
        'Wow Madd, also known as the lengthened Waw (وُ), is a Tajweed rule that applies when the letter Waw (و) appears with a Fatha ( حركةُ الفتحة , the short "u" vowel mark) above it, but without any following Harakat (vowel marks) or Sukun (consonant diacritic indicating no vowel follows). In this specific context, the Waw sound is noticeably extended compared to a regular short "w." The length of the extended Waw sound in Wow Madd is debated among scholars, but it typically ranges from one to two Harakat lengths (the time it takes to pronounce a short vowel). This extension creates a more resonant and emphatic pronunciation of the Waw. Here`s an example: The word "وَمَا (wamaa)" ("and what") features a Wow Madd with the first Waw. When reciting this word, you`ll extend the "w" sound slightly longer than a regular short "w" before moving on to the following vowel sound "aa." ',
